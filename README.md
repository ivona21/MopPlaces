# MopPlaces

Main functionality of this app is currently nothing but searching trough already entered places and filtering it by category (food, clubs and bars). Search results are seen on the places cards as well as on the map.

You'll need some server like Wamp to run this application.
After running server, go to localhost/mopplaces/app
